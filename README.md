# expenses_register

A project developed within the scope of the Udemy course "Web Complete 2020 - 20 courses, 20 projects", using ES6, 
with a focus on object orientation within the application, using a database (Local Storage).

The application is responsive using Bootstrap as a resource.

In addition to the proposal, I created an analysis page that allows you to filter expenses and where you can see the total of those expenses.
